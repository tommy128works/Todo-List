## Project Description

Keep track of yours tasks using this Todo List!

[Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) stores the user's data on the browser itself. This means your projects and tasks will still be there after you close and re-open the page! 

> [!NOTE]
> Web Storage API stores data on the specific user's browser meaning the user's data will not show up if they open the app on another computer.

This project's functionality relied heavily on JavaScript EventListeners. 
ES6 Modules were implemented to improve organization and readability of the code.

Overall, this was a fantastic learning exercise that made me more familiar with EventListeners, factory functions, and writing cleaner code.

Technologies Used:
- Web Storage API
- Webpack
- JavaScript
- CSS and SASS
- Jest Testing
- Bootstrap

Notable Coding Techniques Used:
- ES6 Modules
- HTML Forms
- JavaScript Form Validation
- JavaScript EventListeners
- JavaScript Factory Functions

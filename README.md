# Restaurant-Page

This restaurant page has been changed into a sapling store that sells saplings and offers installation services.

This was a learning exercise for using Webpacks and ES6 Modules to generate the entire contents of the restaurant page.

I have learned that Webpacks have many uses for development and production. A feature I found useful
was webpack-dev-server which automatically refreshed the page. 
I have also found ES6 Modules to be a useful tool in reusing code between files and projects.
